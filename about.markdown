This is the home for the Seattle Xcoders. Our focus is primarily on the family of Cocoa SDK's. The group also explores other related technologies like Unix, relational databases, and scripting languages.  You are invited to share your ideas on how we can best serve your needs and have a bit of fun while doing it. We meet twice per month.

# Group Information

# Redmond (fourth Thursday of each month)

The second monthly meeting is on the Eastside in Redmond at [thinkspace] at 7 PM.

The conference room that we'll be using is on the first floor outside the main entrance. The parking area is on 83rd Ave NE even though the building address is on 164th Ave NE.

# NSCoder Night (every Tuesday night)

NSCoder Night is held Tuesday evenings at [Wayward Coffeehouse][waywardcoffee], [6417 Roosevelt Way NE, Seattle](http://goo.gl/maps/naK2r). It is an informal gathering where people can code, talk shop, ask and answer questions, and find some willing victims for project demonstrations. There is no program, and there is a wide range of experience levels. We're generally there from about 7 until about 10, with people dropping in all through the evening. Look for the Xcoders reserved table in the back.
