This is the home for the Seattle Xcoders. Our focus is primarily on the family of Cocoa SDK's. The group also explores other related technologies like Unix, relational databases, and scripting languages.  You are invited to share your ideas on how we can best serve your needs and have a bit of fun while doing it. We meet twice per month.

# Group Information

# Seattle (second Thursday of each month)

Our Seattle meetings are held at [The Omni Group](http://www.omnigroup.com/): [1000 Dexter Ave N, Suite 400](http://goo.gl/maps/j0Rxc) (just north of the corner of Aloha St, on the east side of the street). Gather on the 1st floor to be taken up to Omni's offices.

The building is accessible via the 26 and 28 buses which stop out front, and the 40 which stops two blocks to the east on Westlake. It's slightly less accessible via the 5 and 16â€”if bussing from the north, get off at Galer St and use the pedestrian bridge. If bussing from the south, get off at Prospect St. Or better yet take the 26, 28 or 40 when coming from downtown if at all possible.

The meetings start at 7pm and usually go for an hour, sometimes longer.

# Redmond (fourth Thursday of each month)

The second monthly meeting is on the Eastside in Redmond at [thinkspace] at 7 PM.

The conference room that we'll be using is on the first floor outside the main entrance. The parking area is on 83rd Ave NE even though the building address is on 164th Ave NE.

# NSCoder Night (every Tuesday night)

NSCoder Night is held Tuesday evenings at [Wayward Coffeehouse](http://www.waywardcoffee.com), [6417 Roosevelt Way NE, Seattle](http://goo.gl/maps/naK2r). It is an informal gathering where people can code, talk shop, ask and answer questions, and find some willing victims for project demonstrations. There is no program, and there is a wide range of experience levels. We're generally there from about 7 until about 10, with people dropping in all through the evening. Look for the Xcoders reserved table in the back.
