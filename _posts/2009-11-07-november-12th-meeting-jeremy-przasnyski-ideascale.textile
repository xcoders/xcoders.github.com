Jeremy Przasnyski - talking about ideascale.

From Jeremy:
I've been working on a feedback plugin for iPhone apps that uses ideascale.com, which is run by a friend of mine. It allows users to suggest features, bug fixes, etc in any app you develop. Users also vote up/down the ideas so you can determine what the really want & implement it next.
