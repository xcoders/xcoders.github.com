With Fraser stuck in Scotland and not able to make it to Seattle, [Brent Simmons](https://twitter.com/brentsimmons) and [Brad Ellis](https://twitter.com/BradEllis) have offered to fill in with their Keynote titled **iPad UI Interactive Volcano Backup Plan Talk**. The topic will be the design of NetNewsWire for iPad.

**Updated**: Please note that this meeting is in Seattle at the Disney location for this month. Thinkspace didn't have the larger room available and arrangements had been made to move to Seattle already.
