We have a special extra Seattle meeting this month. [Fraser Speirs](https://twitter.com/fraserspeirs) of [Connected Flow](http://connectedflow.com) will be presenting a talk on **What's New in iPad UI**. He will be giving a similar talk at the [Voices That Matter: iPhone Developers Conference](http://www.voicesthatmatter.com/iPhone2010/) as well. So this is a great chance to get a preview.

Unfortunately, we could not secure a large enough space at [Thinkspace](http://thinkspace.com) in Redmond so this meeting will be at the usual [Disney](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=925+4th+Ave,+Seattle,+WA+98104&sll=47.633311,-122.351731&sspn=0.009196,0.016565&ie=UTF8&ll=47.614264,-122.32873&spn=0.009635,0.016844&z=14&iwloc=A&source=embed) office location in Seattle. We hope that the Eastsiders will make the trip for this one.
