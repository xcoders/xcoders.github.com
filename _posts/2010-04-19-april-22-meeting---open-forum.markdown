Unfortunately, both [Fraser Speirs](http://twitter.com/fraserspeirs) and [Nate Vander Wilt](http://twitter.com/natevw) have had to cancel for this Thursday. So we'll just have an open forum to talk about iPad, iPhone 4, or anything else you want to discuss. I'm sure the usual meetup at [Cyclops](http://maps.google.com/places/us/wa/seattle/1st-ave/2421/-cyclops?gl=us) will be in order as well.
