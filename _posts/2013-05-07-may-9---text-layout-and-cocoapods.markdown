This month's Seattle meeting features presentations by Kyle Sluder of The Omni Group and Aengus McMillin of the UW Computer Science Department. 

Kyle is a software engineer for Omni, and will be talking about text layout. Aengus is a computer science major at UW, and will be talking about CocoaPods, an open source package management system.

The meeting is Thursday, May 9, on the UW Campus, in Johnson Hall 111, beginning at 7 pm. This is the same room where we met in April. Anyone is welcome. Both of these talks will be of interest to any Cocoa programmer, whether you're targeting OS X or iOS.

The mailing list is still down, so please keep receiving updates via one of the other avenues on the [About page][about].
