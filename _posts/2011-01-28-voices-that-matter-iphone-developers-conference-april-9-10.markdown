The [Voices That Matter: iPhone Developers Conference][vtm] is returning to Seattle again April 9-10, 2011. A great line up of speakers and talks will be presented. The conference is at the [Bell Harbor Internation Conference Center][bell].

The conference will cover iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad development. The schedule includes topics covering UI, Core Data, Objective-C, OpenGL as well as getting your app to market. Speakers include Aaron Hillegass, Mike Lee, Stephan Kochan, and Andy Ihnatko.

Finally, Xcoders can get a nice discount on the registration fees. Like last year, we will plan social outings for the weekend to welcome iOS developers to Seattle.
