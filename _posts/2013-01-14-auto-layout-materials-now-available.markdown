Materials from [Kyle's Auto Layout talk](http://seattlexcoders.org/2013/01/07/january-10---auto-layout-and-google-maps.html) are now available for download:

* [PDF slides](https://s3.amazonaws.com/xcoders/Auto+Layout+Talk+Slides.pdf)
* [Video](https://s3.amazonaws.com/xcoders/Auto+Layout.mp4.zip)

Note: There was something about the screen capture which shifted the cursor away from the actual location it should be at during demos. It can be quite disorienting, but neither Kyle nor I know how to correct it. Sorry.
