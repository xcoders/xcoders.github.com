title: January Schedule - Graphics Month
---
Hey, check it out! I'm posting this *before* January's even here!

We've got some cool stuff coming up... January is "graphics month". Didn't really intend that, but hey - it's pretty cool!

* Jan 11th - Chris Parrish of the "Rogue Sheep":http://www.roguesheep.com/ will be talking a little bit about using Quartz Composer.

* Jan 25th - Lucas Newman, one of the "Delicious Monster":http://www.delicious-monster.com/ crew, will be talking about using Core Graphics.

In February, (Feb 8th) we'll have a couple gents from Apple's crew joining us with topics for the open converssation to revolve around development tools and organizing user's groups (like us!) to encourage more developers.

The calendar links to the right (Google's calendar and iCal) are updated through the first meeting in February...
