title: Sept 23rd Meeting - Hal Mueller iPhone Graphics API lessons learned
---
Hal reports:

I'm still going to do UIScrollView...  Am tinkering now with Quartz drawing and hope also to look at OpenGL ES in the next few days by way of the "Molecules" app. 

So maybe title "iPhone Graphics API lessons learned", or roundtable, or something, to include UIScrollview, and a comparison of Quartz vs GL ES.
