Our next meeting is on Thursday, March 28.

Steve Baker, founder of [Beepscore] will talk about APNS (Apple Push Notification Service). Topics include the Push Notification Path, different components along the path, web server options for push notification (dedicated server, Heroku, Microsoft Windows Azure Mobile Services, Urban Airship etc.) and more.
 
The meeting starts at 7pm (Thursday, March 28) and it will be held in the 1st floor conference room (room 101) of  [Thinkspace] in downtown Redmond.

[Thinkspace] is a 2-minute walk from the Redmond transit center. So if you’re coming over from downtown Seattle, you can take ST Express 545 to get here quickly.
Alternately, if you drive, parking is free.
