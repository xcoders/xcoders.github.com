Dave Peck from [WhereBeUs](http://www.wherebe.us) will be presenting on Mapkit and Core Location. With the release of iOS5, there are no more NDA restrictions on new Location features such as forward-geocoding.
 
The meeting starts at 7 PM at [Thinkspace](http://www.thinkspace.com/about/location) in conference room 101. Thinkspace is in downtown Redmond very close to the Redmond transit center (ST Express 545 from Seattle). There is also plenty of free parking.
