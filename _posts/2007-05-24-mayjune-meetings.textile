Sorry for the late posting. Our Google calendar data got lost or borked or something, so I've been recreating that info. Should be pretty much up to date now.

May 24: Working with NSAttributedString and how to arrange syntax highlighting in your doc.

June 14: NO MEETING - WWDC

June 28: Post WWDC "What are we getting with Leopard?" update, bitch session, and general schmooze.
