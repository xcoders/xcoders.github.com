Our next meeting is on February 28 and our speaker will be Josh Twist, who works in the Windows Azure team at Microsoft.

Josh will talk about Microsoft's cloud-powered backend for iOS apps - Windows Azure Mobile Services. Topics include discussions on the native Objective-C client SDK provided by Windows Azure Mobile services and features such as sending Push notifications to iOS devices.

The meeting starts at 7pm (Thursday, February 28) and it will be held in the 1st floor conference room (room 101) of  [Thinkspace] in downtown Redmond.

[Thinkspace] is a 2-minute walk from the Redmond transit center. So if you’re coming over from downtown Seattle, you can take ST Express 545 to get here quickly.
Alternately, if you drive, parking is free.
