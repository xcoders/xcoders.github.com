Our next meeting is on July 26 and the topic is AV Foundation for iOS. Our speaker will be Robert Eickmann and he'll talk about pushing the limits of AV Foundation for video on iOS devices.

The meeting starts at 7pm (Thursday, July 26) and it will be held in the 1st floor co-working space of [Thinkspace] in downtown Redmond.

[Thinkspace] is a 2-minute walk from the Redmond transit center. So if youâ€™re coming over from downtown Seattle, you can take ST Express 545 to get here quickly.
Alternately, if you drive, parking is free.
