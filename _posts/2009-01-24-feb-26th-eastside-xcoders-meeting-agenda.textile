The agenda for the Feb 26th will be as follows:

1) Bo Gervang will give a presentation on Blocks in Snow Leopard.
2) Jeff Szuhay discuss Ironcoders and walk us through his entry to the contest.
3) We will discuss the first three chapters of Advanced OS X.

From there we will move onto the after meeting socializing at McCormick & Schmicks ($2 1/2lbd Angus Burgers! With Fries!).

Hope to see you all there!
