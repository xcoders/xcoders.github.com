The last meeting of 2007 was fantastic, and we'd like to congratulate Lucas and wish him well as he heads down to Cupertino to joining Apple.

The "presentation and examples from the meeting":http://seattlexcoders.org/shared/Core%20Animation%20Samples.zip are available - you'll need to get a copy of "VoodooPad":http://flyingmeat.com/voodoopad/ to view the presentation. If you don't already own it, just grab the VoodooPad Lite.

Our next meeting will be in January - topic TBD. 

Have a great holiday!
