Michael Buford is doing a cool kid's app with work from one of my favorite painters ever- Vladimir Kush. Here is a [little video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kfo-__rFqG8) of what he has going on.

This meeting Michael will be giving us a little talk about creating the app.

Marc is reserving us a place at the IBM building again. Please arrive BEFORE 7pm, as the building doors are locked for external access at that time.
