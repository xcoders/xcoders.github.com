The upcoming meeting on the 24th is *XCode 3 - The New Stuff*. "Joe Heck":http://www.rhonabwy.com/wp/ will be giving an overview of the new features in XCode 3 and interface building, including snapshots, refactoring support, and "xibs".

We're going to have this meeting at a new location - Getty Images has offered one of their conference rooms, so we'll try it out. They're right down in Fremont - map (hopefully) embedded here to make it easy for y'all to find.

Consider taking the bus here if that's at all convenient for you - as I expect parking to be limited in the area.
