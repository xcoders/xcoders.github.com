The agenda for the Feb 26th will be as follows:

* Bo Gervang will give a presentation on Blocks in Snow Leopard.
* Jeff Szuhay discuss Ironcoders and walk us through his entry to the contest.
* We will discuss the first three chapters of Advanced OS X.

From there we will move onto the after meeting socializing at McCormick & Schmicks ($2 1/2lb Angus Burgers! With Fries!)

Hope to see you all there!
