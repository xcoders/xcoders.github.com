The recently-released Google Maps for iOS app was a project begun at Google's Kirkland office. 

Some of the developers who worked on the (Google Maps) app will make a technical presentation and also answer questions about their work on the app. Topics include their goals for the V1 version of the app, tools and techniques needed to bring maps and navigation to mobile devices and other development aspects of the app.

The meeting starts at 7pm (Thursday, January 24) and it will be held in the 1st floor co-working space of [Thinkspace] in downtown Redmond.

[Thinkspace] is a 2-minute walk from the Redmond transit center. So if youâ€™re coming over from downtown Seattle, you can take ST Express 545 to get here quickly.
Alternately, if you drive, parking is free.
