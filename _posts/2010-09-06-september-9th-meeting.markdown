On the schedule is Alex Vollmer talking about UI Automation Toolkit and Kyle Kincaid showing off his latest creation.

I'm afraid I won't be hosting this Thursday, as I'll be in Alaska this coming week. Rick Gordon, who works with me at Disney, will be hosting the meeting at the Disney offices. 

And... for those who don't follow @brentsimmons on twitter, there's a new Cocoa mailing list that's getting started - "Cocoa Unbound". I'll let someone else explain why it exists, but it has a quickly building following that should make it a very interesting list.
