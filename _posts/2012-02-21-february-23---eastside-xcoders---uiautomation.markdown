The speaker for this month’s Eastside Xcoders meeting will be Steve Baker.
In Steve’s words, he will talk about “how to create your own golem army of beta testers in one easy hour” (with UIAutomation).

The meeting starts at 7 PM on Thursday, February 23. It will be held in conference room 101 of [Thinkspace] in downtown Redmond.

It is a 2-minute walk from the Redmond Transit Center. If you’re coming over from downtown Seattle, you can take ST Express 545 to get here. Additionally, there is plenty of free parking.
