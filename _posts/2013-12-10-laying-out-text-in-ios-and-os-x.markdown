title: December 10 - Laying Out Text in iOS and OS X

Our next meeting is Thursday, December 12, and our speaker will be Kyle Sluder of The Omni Group. 

With the advent of Text Kit, both iOS and OS X provide an extremely powerful text layout and drawing engine built atop Core Text. Learn about the various ways to specify fonts, measure and draw text, and lay out paragraphs while respecting the directionality of your user's chosen script.

The meetings starts at 7 pm. Note that Seattle meetings are now held at [The Omni Group](http://www.omnigroup.com/): [1000 Dexter Ave N, Suite 400](http://goo.gl/maps/j0Rxc) (just north of the corner of Aloha St, on the east side of the street). The building's garage closes at 6pm; neighborhood street parking is free after 6pm.

There may be access via the elevator, but for now assume you should gather on the 1st floor to be taken up to Omni's offices.

The building is accessible via the 26 and 28 buses which stop out front, and the 40 which stops two blocks to the east on Westlake. It's slightly less accessible via the 5 and 16â€”if bussing from the north, get off at Galer St and use the pedestrian bridge. If bussing from the south, get off at Prospect St. Or better yet take the 26, 28 or 40 when coming from downtown if at all possible.
