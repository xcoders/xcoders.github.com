title: End of WWDC

And with today <a href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/index.html">WWDC</a> is over for 2006. It's been an excellent conference, and I think that pretty much all of the XCoders who made it there are now completely exhausted. A few of us are heading back today, a few tomorrow. 

There was quite the Seattle showing - with maybe a dozen different folks from Seattle, not even counting the crew from <a href="http://www.delicious-monster.com/">Delicious Monster</a> or <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/">OmniGroup</a>, both of whom showed up in force.

If you're interested in the keynote, it's <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/qtv/wwdc06/">available online</a> - although frankly I think <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/index.html">the pages they posted about Leopard preview have a great deal more information</a> on them.

It was funny, in fact - hearing about things on the mailing that we didn't at all hear about in the keynote. They've become more clear with the conference, but of course we're under NDA - so don't expect any secret details to get posted here...
