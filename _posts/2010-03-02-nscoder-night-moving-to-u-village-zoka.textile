title: NSCoder Night moving to U Village Zoka
---
From Professor Mueller:

I haven't heard any strong opinions voiced one way or the other about the NSCoder Night venue. People that have been to U Village Zoka seem to like it ok. I note that the noise level is lower, it's less crowded, and power outlets are easier to find.

So let's stick with the U Village Zoka, 2901 NE Blakeley Street, for the indefinite future. 7 pm onward.

I won't be there for most of them for a while as I will be teaching 6-9 in Bellevue. But I will drop by tonight, 9:30-9:45 or so.

Hal
