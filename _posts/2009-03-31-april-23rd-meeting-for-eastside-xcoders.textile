title: April 23rd Meeting for Eastside XCoders
---
The current plan of action for our next Eastside meeting will be as follows:

1) Presentation by me on Silverlight. Hopefully using Eclipse4SL toolset on a Mac but technical issues are blocking that right now.

2) We decided to form a small group to work on a game between now and next meeting. At this meeting the group will present what they have, walk through code, talk about issues and solutions, etc.

3) Advanced OS X chp 7-9

I hope to see you all there.
