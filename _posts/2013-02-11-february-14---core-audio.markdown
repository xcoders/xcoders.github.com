February's Seattle meeting will be Thursday, February 14 at 7PM. Izzy Fraimow of Ãœbermind will be presenting on Core Audio: What audio is, how computers handle audio, what Core Audio provides and how to use it for things like generating sounds, applying effects to input, music visualizers, etc. I will have two more video sets to give away: NSConference 2009 (the first, still great topics like Core Animation, Secure Apps and F-Script), and a bundle of QTKit+App Design 3-pack from NSConf mini 2012.

This month's meeting will be held at [SURF Incubator](http://www.surfincubator.com/location/) (The Exchange Building, 821 Second Ave., Suite 800). There's an entrance on 1st Ave, but please use the entrance on 2nd Ave (near the Tully's) to make building security less of a hassle. The CPS garage at 1st and Columbia doesn't have awful rates for downtown parking. Street parking does open up around the building after 6pm so there is usually plenty available on Madison and Marion Streets. If you can't get into the building, please call Rob at (206) 295-1605.

Many, many thanks to SURF Incubator for the last-minute meeting location.
