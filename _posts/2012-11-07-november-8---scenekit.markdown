We will be meeting on Thursday, November 8 at 7 PM. Hal Mueller will be presenting on Scene Kit. We'll probably end up at the Cyclops afterward as usual.

Scene Kit is a new 3D graphics framework available only on OS X Mountain Lion. It takes a high level, Objective-C approach to 3D graphics and animations. 3D objects, lights, and POV cameras are manipulated as nodes of a scene tree. Their positions and properties can be manipulated with Core Animation style calls, and you can intermingle Core Animation layers, Scene Kit views and objects, and custom OpenGL shaders. 

**THE MEETING IS NOT DOWNTOWN!!**

This week we will be on the main UW campus, in Mary Gates Hall 074 on the "G" (ground floor) level. It's just south of Suzzallo library and Red Square. You can find it in the lower right of this [map](http://cl.ly/image/1E2X183F273o). If you walk into the building from the north (from Red Square), you enter on the 1st floor. It's on the next floor down, toward the south end.

Meany Central Parking Garage is the closest parking. It's $5 per night.
