Our next meeting is on Thursday, 1/23 and our speaker will be Alberto Fonseca, founder of [Game Loop]

Alberto will provide an introduction to the Unity game engine and he will talk about how his company used Unity to create a cross-platform mobile game. He also plans to give a free copy of the "Unity iOS Game Development, Beginner's Guide" book to one attendee at the meeting.

The meeting starts at 7pm (Thursday, January 23) and it will be held in the 1st floor conference room of [Thinkspace] in downtown Redmond.

[Thinkspace] is a 2-minute walk from the Redmond transit center. So if youâ€™re coming over from downtown Seattle, you can take ST Express 545 to get here quickly.
Alternately, if you drive, parking is free.
