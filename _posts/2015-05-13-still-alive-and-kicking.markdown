No, we're not dead. If anything, we're stronger than ever! Most of our scheduling and communication has moved to [Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/xcoders/) and keeping multiple locations in sync falls by the wayside.

We'll be keeping the lights on here as a fallback, but come join us on [Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/xcoders/) and subscribe to [its calendar](http://www.meetup.com/xcoders/events/) to stay up to date.
