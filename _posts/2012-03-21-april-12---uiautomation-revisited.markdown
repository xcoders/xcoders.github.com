Since we last looked at UIAutomation, Apple has made several improvements and the community has responded with its own enhancements. We'll look at what's new and what still needs to be addressed. [Alex Vollmer][alexvollmer] of [Radiant Capsule][radiantcapsule] will be presenting.

The meeting will be at [Disney's office][about] at 7 PM.
