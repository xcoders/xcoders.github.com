Happy Holidays and all the good stuff. If you're in the Seattle area, please be safe over the next week. It's awfully nice having a "white christmas" but I don't want to see anyone hurt.

Our first meeting of 2009 will be Jan 8th in our new downtown location - the Disney Interactive Media Group offices in Seattle. 

The meeting time is slightly changed as well - please arrive around 6:30pm, and no later than 7pm. Disney's offices are in the 4th & Madison building (used to be called the IDX building) at 925 Fourth Ave, and the external doors are locked at 7pm.

The entrances to the office are on <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=925+4th+Ave,+Seattle,+WA+98104&sll=47.633311,-122.351731&sspn=0.009196,0.016565&g=925+4th+Ave,+Seattle,+WA+98104&ie=UTF8&ll=47.60583,-122.332592&spn=0.009201,0.016565&t=h&z=16&iwloc=addr&layer=c&cbll=47.605914,-122.332677&panoid=cIAt0X6DoviO2mTADrnctA&cbp=12,221.2657615992657,,0,-17.845430754296203">4th Ave</a> and <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=925+4th+Ave,+Seattle,+WA+98104&sll=47.633311,-122.351731&sspn=0.009196,0.016565&g=925+4th+Ave,+Seattle,+WA+98104&ie=UTF8&t=h&layer=c&cbll=47.605423,-122.333901&panoid=0Wyx5AtmfpX_UQ-TkzTauA&cbp=12,26.938491668893107,,0,-6.298555427396508&ll=47.605324,-122.333815&spn=0.0023,0.008283&z=17&iwloc=addr">3rd Ave</a>.
