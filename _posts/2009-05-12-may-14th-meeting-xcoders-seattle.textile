title: May 14th Meeting - Xcoders Seattle
---
Just a quick reminder that we're having an Xcoders meeting this thursday (May 14th).

It's an open topic forum - discussing lessons learned with iPhone development with the good folks from Black Pixel Luminance (that would be Kyle and Dan, maybe some others if they get dragged along).

Remember to be at the 4th & Madison building well before 7pm if you're coming - the elevators stop moving up at 7pm. We'll hold the forum start until 7pm, but please plan to be here around 6:30pm.
