This month, Paul Goracke of Black Pixel presents "Core Data Potpourri": a mix of practices, some advanced techniques, and a few performance tips.

The meeting starts at 7 pm. Note that Seattle meetings are now held at [The Omni Group](http://www.omnigroup.com/): [1000 Dexter Ave N, Suite 400](http://goo.gl/maps/j0Rxc) (just north of the corner of Aloha St, on the east side of the street). The building's garage closes at 6pm; neighborhood street parking is free after 6pm.

Access is via the elevator, but you need an escort. Gather on the 1st floor to be taken up to Omni's offices. Remember to sign in and sign out at the reception desk.

The building is accessible via the 26 and 28 buses which stop out front, and the 40 which stops two blocks to the east on Westlake. It's slightly less accessible via the 5 and 16—if bussing from the north, get off at Galer St and use the pedestrian bridge. If bussing from the south, get off at Prospect St. Or better yet take the 26, 28 or 40 when coming from downtown if at all possible.
