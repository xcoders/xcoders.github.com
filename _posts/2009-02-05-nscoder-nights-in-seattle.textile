title: NSCoder nights in Seattle

Evening all,

While I'm working on a topic for our next Xcoders meeting (a week from tomorrow), I wanted to mention on the blog that NSCoder Night in Seattle is going along quite well!

Hal Mueller spun up a regular meeting at Greenlake Zoka's on Tuesday evenings from 7 to 9pm. It's been regularly well attended, so I've added it to our <a href=http://www.seattlexcoders.org/calendar">calendar</a> of events. 

If you're in the area, having some code you're hacking on and want to join like minded folks - then definitely stop by!
