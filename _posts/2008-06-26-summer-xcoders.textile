What? Yeah, yeah - we're having meetings!

Tonights meeting, for example, is Chris Parrish going into Quartz Composer and how to develop your own patches for it. 

We're still working the schedule for July and August, but we do have the meetings all set aside. For specifics as they're happening, please check out the Google calendar link - it's the definitive source for what's happening.
