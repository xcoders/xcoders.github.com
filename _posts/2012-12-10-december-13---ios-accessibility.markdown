December's Seattle meeting will be Thursday, December 13 at 7PM. Jake Carter of The Omni Group will be presenting on Accessibility in iOS.

Using iOS 3.0 and later, VoiceOver is available to help users with visual impairments use their iOS-based devices. The UI Accessibility programming interface, introduced in iOS 3.0, helps developers make their applications accessible to VoiceOver users. Briefly, VoiceOver describes an application’s user interface and helps users navigate through the application’s views and controls, using speech and sound. Jake will demonstrate the usage of VoiceOver and introduce us to the Accessibility APIs for iOS.

We will again be on the [main UW campus](http://www.washington.edu/maps/?mgh), in [Mary Gates Hall](https://maps.google.com/maps?client=safari&oe=UTF-8&ie=UTF8&q=mary+gates+hall&fb=1&gl=us&hq=mary+gates+hall&hnear=0x5490102c93e83355:0x102565466944d59a,Seattle,+WA&cid=803089670191794332&t=h&z=16&vpsrc=0&iwloc=A) Room 074 on the "G" (ground floor) level. It's just south of Suzzallo Library and Red Square. 

If you walk into the building from the north (Grant Lane, from Red Square), use the door farthest to the right. Go down the stairs, and head to the far end of the building. (There may be other entry doors open at that time, but I haven't explored.)

[Parking is available](http://www.washington.edu/facilities/transportation/commuterservices/files/images/gatehouse_map_5_7_10.jpg) in a number of campus lots at a nominal $5 flat rate--*except* the Central Garage (Gatehouse 1) is $10 (contrary to the information spread last month). You may also be able to find street parking in the campus surrounds.
