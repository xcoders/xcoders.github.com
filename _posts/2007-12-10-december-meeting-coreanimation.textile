title: December meeting - CoreAnimation
---
December's meeting is all about CoreAnimation. Lucas Newman, of Delicious Monster and iPhone hackery fame, is going to show a number of demonstrations and examples of CoreAnimation for us, and how to "make it go".

This is our only meeting in December - that whole "holidays" thing taking up the other normal time slot. We'll resume normally with the first meeting of 2008 being January 17th (the 2nd Thursday).

Come on by thursday evening (Dec 13th), 7pm at the <a href="http://www.seattlexcoders.org/directions">dBug Resource Center</a>.
