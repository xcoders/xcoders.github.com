This month, Nathaniel Irons of Black Pixel covers Selected Topics in Automated Builds. He'll be be talking about Jenkins and Travis CI, and about Xcode itself. The focus is on how Black Pixel has used automated builds for themselves and clients, with a hope of sparking some ideas that others may wish to steal.


The meeting starts at 7 pm, and will be held at [The Omni Group](http://www.omnigroup.com/): [1000 Dexter Ave N, Suite 400](http://goo.gl/maps/j0Rxc) (just north of the corner of Aloha St, on the east side of the street). The building's garage closes at 6pm; neighborhood street parking is free after 6pm.

Access is via the elevator, but you need an escort. Gather on the 1st floor to be taken up to Omni's offices. Remember to sign in and sign out at the reception desk.

The building is accessible via the 26 and 28 buses, which stop out front, and the 40, which stops two blocks to the east on Westlake. It's slightly less accessible via the 5 and 16: if bussing from the north, get off at Galer St and use the pedestrian bridge. If bussing from the south, get off at Prospect St. Or better yet take the 26, 28 or 40 when coming from downtown if at all possible.
