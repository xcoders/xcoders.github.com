title: Feb 12th Meeting - iPhone internals for beginners
---
Our meeting on February 12th (downtown Seattle - 4th & Madison Building) will be by....  me! (Joe Heck)

I'm going to take the opportunity to inflict a bit of tutorial/workshop effort that I've created upon whomever attends, seeing how it flows and getting feedback.

Specifically, I'm aiming to describe to folks new to the iPhone & Cocoa frameworks how the whole package (nibs, frameworks, etc) all zip together and where best to put in your code for control, effect, design, etc.

The working title for this is current "the guts of the iPhone frameworks - how it all links together".
