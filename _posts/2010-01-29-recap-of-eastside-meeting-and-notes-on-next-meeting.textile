title: Recap of Eastside meeting and notes on next meeting
---
We had a record turnout last night with double the attendance and a lot of new faces. I'd like to says "Welcome!" to all the new people who showed up and I hope to see you all at the next meeting!

Last night we had a good discussion about the Cocoa Design Patterns book and MVC and Gerard gave a good, if short, presentation on Grand Central Dispatch.

All in all a good meeting.

Next meeting will be February 25th. The agenda will be:

1) Discussion about chapters 3, 4 & 5 in Cocoa Design Patterns, lead by Jeff Szuhay.
2) A presentation on Field Editor and NSCell by Joe Jones.
3) Free talk and discussion.

I hope to see everyone there.
