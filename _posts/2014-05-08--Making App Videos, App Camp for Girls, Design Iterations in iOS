Seattle Xcoders has three talks scheduled for the downtown meeting this month.

<h6>How to App Video</h6>

Mark Boszko, 18-year veteran of broadcast TV, now makes promo videos for The Omni Group. In his presentation, get an overview of the entire process of making a video to promote your app, so youâ€™ll grok the language your video producer is speaking, plus hear some helpful tips for those of you looking to do it on your own.

<h6>App Camp for Girls: Seattle edition</h6>

Liz Marley, in the first lightning talk we've held at these meetings, will give us a brief summary of what App Camp for Girls is all about. It's coming to Seattle this summer for the first time.

<h6>Design Iteration in an iOS Project</h4>

Jeff Johnston talks about lessons learned in multiple design iterations for an iOS app.

The meeting starts at 7 pm, and will be held at [The Omni Group](http://www.omnigroup.com/): [1000 Dexter Ave N, Suite 400](http://goo.gl/maps/j0Rxc) (just north of the corner of Aloha St, on the east side of the street). The building's garage closes at 6pm; neighborhood street parking is free after 6pm.

Access is via the elevator, but you need an escort. Gather on the 1st floor to be taken up to Omni's offices. Remember to sign in and sign out at the reception desk.

The building is accessible via the 26 and 28 buses, which stop out front, and the 40, which stops two blocks to the east on Westlake. It's slightly less accessible via the 5 and 16: if bussing from the north, get off at Galer St and use the pedestrian bridge. If bussing from the south, get off at Prospect St. Or better yet take the 26, 28 or 40 when coming from downtown if at all possible.
