Adobe is graciously hosting us for the meeting on December 11th. It's down in the Fremont area, so be fore-warned in regards to Parking - you might have to hunt around a bit for on-street parking.

The address is

701 N 34th St
Seattle, WA 98103
USA
Room is called Fairhaven, should be fine for 20-25 people.

Adobe has asked for a list of folks who will be attending, so Brent has knocked together a signup sheet with Google Forms. If you're planning on coming to the December meeting, please sign up at

Adobe is asking for a reasonably accurate list by December 1st for the meeting on the 11th.
